This is my player_1_turn function //
It allows for Player 1 to pick a spot on Player 2's board to try and sink a ship //

This is my didIWin function //
It shows if Player 1 or Player 2 has sunk all of the opposing ships //
Whenever a ship on the board is guessed, the space is replaced with the word "S" for Sunk. The code then counts to see if the string "S" appears 3 times in the opposing board //
