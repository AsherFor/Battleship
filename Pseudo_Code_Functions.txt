This is my player_1_turn function //
It allows for Player 1 to pick a spot on Player 2's board to try and sink a ship //
Player 1 enters a row and a column to try and sink a ship. If Player 1 chooses a space where there is a ship, the code puts "S" for Sunk. If they miss, the code puts M //

BOARD_PLAYER_2 = [5][5]

    if FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_ROW = int(0, 5) then
        if FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_COL = int(0, 5) then
            if BOARD_PLAYER_2[FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_ROW][FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_COL] == "C" or "U" then
                output "Player 1 hit Player 2's battleship!"
                output BOARD_PLAYER_2[FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_ROW][FIRE_OPPOSING_SHIPS_COL] = "S"
            end if

    end if
end PLAYER_1_TURN()

This is my didIWin function //
It shows if Player 1 or Player 2 has sunk all of the opposing ships //
Whenever a ship on the board is guessed, the space is replaced with the word "S" for Sunk. The code then counts to see if the string "S" appears 3 times in the opposing board //
